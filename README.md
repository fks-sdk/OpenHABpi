OpenHABpi
=========

Running openHAB on the Raspberry PI

Inside this repo you'll find 2 sections:
 - base
 - addon

You surely need the base package which will
 - make openhab start on boot
 - make it run inside RAM thus minimizing SD card writes
 - allow you to change your config from windows (samba-share)

additionally, I added some of my compiles:
 - addon/eibd offers the popular eibd as binaries
 - addon/rc-switch offers https://github.com/r10r/rcswitch-pi precompiled

I'll need a few days to get going with git so in the meantime I'll push my sd-card-image :)
